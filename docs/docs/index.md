# AtlasBuilder

AtlasBuilder is a free and open-source python tool that enables you to produce functional boxplots for
your data. It was designed to enable the production of atlases for either all or a part of a population.
AtlasBuilder supports four differnet algorithms for atlas construction:

- Indicator un-weighted
- Proportional un-weighted
- Indicator weighted
- Proportonal weighted

AtlasBuilder makes it easy to construct a multitude of atlases quickly and with little code.

## Features

- Simple API for importing data
- Ability to import data from multiple sources
- Simple API for specifying atlas details
- Ability to generate multiple atlases from the same data at one time
- Ability to produce output graphs as desired

Visit the [examples](/Examples/) page for code examples for using AtlasBuilder.
